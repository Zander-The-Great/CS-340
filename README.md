How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

-In order to write programs that are maintainable,readable, and adaptable is to code functionally and practically. We practice alot of the industry standard practices in order to make our code up to spec on current standards. These standards are always being raised from time to time as things naturally progress. It is up to us to keep up to date on the best practices in the feild. Generally there is a baseline to follow but keeping current and on par will make the end product more maintainable, readable, and adaptable.


How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

-For me when I approach a problem I like to start from the ground up. I feel like all projects should have strong foundation. If there is a strong foundation it will only make the end product that much more structurally sound. Usually I start by understanding the requirements that are needed. Once this happens we can figure out what takes priority make sure all needs are met. Personally I use checklists to ensure everything has been addressed.

These projects had a few differences for me. The first big one was coding in python. The logic is relative but the syntax was something different that I had to adjust to and learn. The other portion was not just making an application but creating a whole front end. To me it was cool to see the integration from creating a database, to coding functions to utilize it, to making the front end to create a better visual. This was really a full spectrum and I felt accomplished after completing this.

Other techniques or stratigies I could have used would have been dependincy checks and more security tests. This in conjunction with more code optimization to make sure there arent any flaws that could be potentially exploited in the code. Im sure there is a baseline level of security within this but if this was going through in real life we have to be weary of people with malicious intent. We want to provide a sense of saftey and security for our clients that brings a measure of professionalism so they know they can rely on us.



What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

-Computer scientiests pave the way for technology and people to come together. Every day we are looking for ways to make our work flow improve. This can be done with tools, integration, automation, optimization..ect. This is an incredible time to be alive to see where technology started and where we are now. Technology has grow exponentially and we have to keep up in order to maximize its uses to benifit humanity and this world.

My work on this type of project towards a company like Grazio Salvare will help them in a multitue of ways. Tasks that could have been tedious can now be done more optimally. Database information can be seen more clearly allowing them to analyze data easier. The posibilities are endless. Depending on the companies needs we can tailor what our projects/products can do for them. The end goal is to provide them with the tools they need to make their jobs and lives easier. In turn this will make the quality of their work go up and everyone will benifit.
